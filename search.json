    "text": "Description\nOver the past 4 years, the pharmaverse was created and has blossomed into a booming community of organizations and package developers aimed at supporting R development with focus on the clinical reporting pipeline. Even within a world as standardized as regulatory submissions, organizations still tend to have sometimes vastly different requirements within their own processes.\nIn this workshop, we‚Äôll give a high level overview of the scope and tools available within the pharmaverse for the clinical pipeline, including tools for ADaM data set curation, creating Analysis Results Data Sets, and TLGs. To help attendees understand how there are different paradigms and pathways through the pharmaverse, we‚Äôll take a tour through two to three different strategies available to support table, listing, and figure creation. Attendees of this workshop will walk away with an understanding of how the pharmaverse can help their organization and where they can look to learn more about the right tools to support their needs.",

    "text": "August 7, 2024\nHello everyone! We are excited to spend the day with you for the Flavors of the Pharmaverse workshop at posit::conf on Monday, August 12!\nIn this workshop, we‚Äôll give a high level overview of the scope and tools available within the Pharmaverse for the clinical pipeline, focusing on ADaMs through outputs. Our hope is that you will walk away with an understanding of how there are different paradigms and pathways through the pharmaverse. A basic understanding of R and tidyverse is expected for this workshop. More information about the workshop can be found here: https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/pharmaverse/ (will be updated up to the workshop).\nFor the day to run smoothly, please be sure to bring your own laptop and charger so you can follow along and do the exercises. We will be using Posit Cloud, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about getting anything installed on your computer. Just make sure you have a free Posit Cloud account before the workshop starts.\nDuring the workshop, we will be using Slack as our main communication method. A link to our dedicated Slack channel will be sent to your email separately ‚Äì please keep an eye out for that! If you have any questions before the workshop, please feel free to drop them in the Slack channel.\nYour instructors,\nAndrew, Becca, Casey, Daniel, and Ellis",
