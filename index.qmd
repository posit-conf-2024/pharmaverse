## Description

Over the past 4 years, the pharmaverse was created and has blossomed
into a booming community of organizations and package developers aimed
at supporting R development with focus on the clinical reporting
pipeline. Even within a world as standardized as regulatory submissions,
organizations still tend to have sometimes vastly different requirements
within their own processes.

In this workshop, we‚Äôll give a high level overview of the scope and
tools available within the pharmaverse for the clinical pipeline,
including tools for ADaM data set curation, creating Analysis Results
Data Sets, and TLGs. To help attendees understand how there are
different paradigms and pathways through the pharmaverse, we‚Äôll take a
tour through two to three different strategies available to support
table, listing, and figure creation. Attendees of this workshop will
walk away with an understanding of how the pharmaverse can help their
organization and where they can look to learn more about the right tools
to support their needs.
